## How to run locally

Follow some of the instructions in the [github tutorial] (https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)
but it is less complicated even. #TODO: Dockerize

To install necessary libs:

`gem install bundler`

`bundle install`


To run on localhost:4000 :
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
