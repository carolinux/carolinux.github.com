Summer is here, bringing with it a tide of creative energy and some free time. For that reason, I have decided to open commissions for portraits (humans AND animals!). I work with acrylics on canvas.

Here is some work people have commissioned me for in the past:

Portraits like this are great as gifts or for decorating your own house. After an initial short consultation to get an idea of what you want, for example, in terms of impact and colors, I can work with reference pictures.
