I like to create memes for myself and my friends. In fact, I had put lolcat-like speech on the vacation pictures of my friend group from 2008, but the world was not ready then. It is also probably not ready now. Anyhow, here goes, another list of things:

<ul>
<li><a href="../../assets/img/project/friendly_hose.jpg">A friendly hose</a></li> 
<li><a href="../../assets/img/project/grand_canary.png">Gran Canaria map</a> (as a grand canary)</li> 
<li><a href="../../assets/img/project/tide_pods.jpg">As a thank you to my friend who hosted me, I left him some snacks</a></li> 
<li><a href="../../assets/img/project/corners.png">When I have cut corners in developing code</a></li> 
<li><a href="../../assets/img/project/crepe_bowties.png">For a friend's wedding</a> (if you look closely, the bowties are <a href="../../assets/img/project/crepes.jpg">crepes</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/carolinux/cv/blob/honest/KarolinaAlexiouCV.pdf">'Alternative Facts' CV</a></li>


</ul>
