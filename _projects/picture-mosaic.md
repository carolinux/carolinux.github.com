It can be found over at <a href="https://github.com/carolinux/mosaic">github</a> (Python repo). Developed during hackathons, so very hacky, but also very fun. I implemented a KD-tree from scratch and also learned some things about how the human brain does not perceive differences in color uniformly in the RGB space, hence a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference#CIELAB_Delta_E*">different color space</a> should be used.</p>

During my time at <a href="https://www.siroop.ch">siroop</a>, we used the tool internally to create fancy mosaics made out of pictures of the products in the online shop, and then print those  as gifts or use them in presentations.</p>
