<p>

My philosophy is to build software and infrastructure that is at simple as it can be and can fit your company's or individual's needs.
I invest time in understanding your needs and finding the best way to "speak your language". Get in touch with me for a non-binding offer at <a href="mailto://hello@lucidcode.ch">hello@lucidcode.ch</a>.
I offer services in building AWS infrastructure, data engineering projects and technical hiring.
